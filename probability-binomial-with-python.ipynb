        "Many historians of probability note the emergence of a theory of probability as linked to humans attempts to understand games of chance. We begin with an early example called Senet that is at least as old as the year 3000 BC. Here, players' moves are decided by dropping 4 paddles with two colored faces. The players are allowed to move based on the number of colored paddles that are facing up. Our goal is to explore the likely outcomes of the drops to begin to understand probability.\n",
